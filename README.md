# Custom-RF-Board-with-STM32G030
This repository contains the complete hardware design of a **4-layer PCB** based on the **STM43G030K8T6**microcontroller.This board is designed for controlling an RF module through **SPI interface**, along with onboard power circuitry, SWD programming pins, and user input/output components.
## Project Includes
- Altium schematic ('.SchDoc')
- PCB layout ('.PcbDoc')
- Project file ('.PrjPcb')
- PDF exports of schematic & PCB
- Manufacturing-ready files (Gerbers can be added later)
## Key Features
- **STM32G030K8T6 microcontrller**
- **SPI interface** for RF module communication
- **UFL RF connector footprint**
- **SWD programming interface** (SWCLK, SWDIO)
- Reset push button with pull-up resistor**
- **Status LED**
- **External crysta footprint (optional)**
- Clean **4-layer stackup**:
  - L1: Signals  
  - L2: Ground plane  
  - L3: Power (3.3V/Charging rails)  
  - L4: Signals 
## Tools Used
- **Altium Designer 25**
- GitHub Desktop for version control
## Notes
- This is the Version 1 of the PCB.
- This project currently represents a **hardware-only design** (no firmware included).  
- The design may still undergo improvements and review.
- Anyone interested can modify the design.
## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the `.PrjPcb` file in **Altium Designer**  
3. View or modify schematic and PCB as needed
